# C Learning Path

**To mark a topic as complete, I must be able to:**
1. **Explain it:** Describe the concept in my own words, including *why* and *how* it works.
2. **Write it:** Implement it from scratch in working C code without copying or heavy reference.
3. **Apply it:** Use it in a slightly different or combined context (e.g., in a small project, function, or debugging scenario).
4. **Debug it:** Recognize common mistakes or undefined behaviors related to it and know how to fix them.
5. **Teach it:** Confidently explain it to someone else as if they’re new to the topic.

**Exercises for each topic:**
1. Implement a fundamental version.
2. Implement a more complex version.
3. Implement a bug with reason why it fails.
4. Write a short essay on the topic.
