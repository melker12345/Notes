This is me typing now this is a lot better then before.
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogs.

so tomorrow i want to work.
prehaps some coding on my display.  
then when i come home i want to read a bit.

todo for the display is to create tose binary ararys for each remaining letter.
find a way to display them on a row rather then one per row.

then also we need to figure out how to make the screen moven:
   - this means we need a speed.
   - then we need to update the pixels to move one step per cycle.
