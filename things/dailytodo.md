today I want to learn to type on this key board.
this will take some time since I for one is not used to ortholinear keyboards, and also I need to learn US layout and also the layers is a bit tricky.

This keyboard feels good though but i feel retarded since i can not even type on it.

I'm so slow, is not even funny

How long will this take to learn to type on??

I'm already seeing some improvements!!!

This is something that will really be beneficial for me since
